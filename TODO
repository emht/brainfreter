* Read the input from file having extension of brainf**k supported files.
* Read input line by line like an interpreter
* Ignore the spaces between the symbols
* Allow Commenting with symbols // and "/**/".
* Allow the shell scripting feature as in bash shell and python shell.

* Take care of all the errors that might be generated and handle them well. Output the error with error codes and the documentation help reference to help user debug the error.

* Make a simple interpreter to read and understand the Brainf**k interpreter
* Add security feature to prevent unauthorised access to more than assigned 10 cells for the brainf**k interpreter.  i.e. prevent unauthorised access to other variables/pointers.

* Add the regex feature over here.
* Add the feature to automatically move to next cell after taking input (which may or may not be useful)

* Clarify all the comments and delete all the blobs if present.

* Make all these functions in a separate library and include them in the driving program via its header file.

* Once successfully developed, reimplement this whole interpreter in c++ incorporating OOP compatibility.

* Add the graphical interface if possible, both in C and C++.


* Like some Web Apps, add a feature to read strings and convert it into brainf**k code.  And integrate your C code with backend of your website written in C. :P
