Introduction
============
- It is an interpreter made specifically for Brainf**k language.
- Allows inline as well as multiline commenting.
- Ignores spaces between scripts.

Features
========
* A bf supported file i.e. .bf/.b can be interpreted
* A session can be created for user to enter the brainf**k commands as in bash shell.  The session can be closed by "exit()" or "!" command.
* 

Symbols Used 
============

* > : Move the pointer one cell to the left
* < : Move the pointer one cell to the right
* + : Increment the value present in the current cell
* - : Decrement the value present in the current cell
* [ : Skips to '[' if value at current cell is '0', else follow next instruction
* ] : Move backwards if value at current cell is not '0' else keep going
* . : print the value corresponding to the ascii value at the current cell
* , : takes and store the ascii value of the input by user and store it in current cell.

Error/Exit Codes
================

- Exit(1): The file does not exit or is not accessible.
- Exit(2): Unsupported file format.  Only ".b" and ".bf" file formats are supported in this version.
- Exit(3): Cannot open file in read mode, check if its permissible or not in use anywhere.
